surf - simple webkit-based browser
==================================
surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+.

Requirements
------------
In order to build surf you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.

In order to use the functionality of the url-bar, also install dmenu[0].

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (surf is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install surf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running surf
------------
run
    surf [URI]

See the manpage for further options.

Running surf in tabbed
----------------------
For running surf in tabbed[1] there is a script included in the distribution,
which is run like this:

    surf.sh [URI] [URI] [URI] ...

Further invocations of the script will run surf with the specified URI in this
instance of tabbed.
